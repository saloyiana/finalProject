### The working flow:

## Week 1:   

**Dockerfiles building and running.**

- Day1: understanding the requirements of the project, and what I should deliver in the end.
- Day2: Cloning the microservices in one repo and start to build the frontend image using their ready Dockerfile and works without any editing. 
- Day3: Started with the catalogue microservice, the struggle with the Dockerfile starts, after building the image the permission denied issue appeared, skip it for now!
- Day4: Today's image was a cart, and the plugins of the pom file needed to be edited, and then built a new multistage Dockerfile and try to run it.
- Day5: Shipping and payment have been done today ( similar to yesterday's job ) and everything kinda went smoothly after yesterdayâ€™s struggle.
- Day6: Today was user and its database day, I have a problem with the permission denied again, the building phase is successfully done though.
- Day7: Today is the day of building and running the queue master image and the order image, I faced a lot of errors, some of them I faced before.
